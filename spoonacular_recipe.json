Cook just until the the onion and garlic softens, about 7 minutes or so.While your veggies are cooking, chop up your kale and get it ready to go, but don't add it yet.  You don't need to worry about chopping the spinach leaves, when it comes time to add them, just use the whole leaf.Once your veggies are cooked, drain your lentils and add them and the rice to the veggies. If you can't find a black rice, just use wild rice.Give the veggies, rice and lentils a stir and then add your veggie broth, water, kale, spinach and all of the spices and turn the heat to high.Keep the burner on high just until the soup boils, reduce the heat to low and cover for 25 minutes. Covering the soup will ensure that the lentils and rice cook thoroughly.After the soup cooks covered for 25 minutes, remove the cover and continue to cook on low for another 30 minutes or so.  I added another 1/2 tsp of salt and a bit of pepper for flavoring at this point and it was a perfect balance.After the final 30 minutes of simmer, simply serve and enjoy!","ingredients":[{"id":10011457,"name":"spinach","localizedName":"spinach","image":"spinach.jpg"},{"id":0,"name":"green lentils","localizedName":"green lentils","image":"lentils-brown.jpg"},{"id":10020036,"name":"black rice","localizedName":"black rice","image":"black-rice.jpg"},{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","localizedName":"olive oil","image":"olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":20088,"name":"wild rice","localizedName":"wild rice","image":"rice-wild-uncooked.png"},{"id":11124,"name":"carrot","localizedName":"carrot","image":"sliced-carrot.png"},{"id":10316069,"name":"lentils","localizedName":"lentils","image":"lentils-brown.jpg"},{"id":11143,"name":"celery","localizedName":"celery","image":"celery.jpg"},{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","localizedName":"garlic","image":"garlic.png"},{"id":1002030,"name":"pepper","localizedName":"pepper","image":"pepper.jpg"},{"id":2035,"name":"spices","localizedName":"spices","image":"spices.png"},{"id":1006615,"name":"broth","localizedName":"broth","image":"chicken-broth.png"},{"id":11282,"name":"onion","localizedName":"onion","image":"brown-onion.png"},{"id":1006615,"name":"stock","localizedName":"stock","image":"chicken-broth.png"},{"id":14412,"name":"water","localizedName":"water","image":"water.png"},{"id":11233,"name":"kale","localizedName":"kale","image":"kale.jpg"},{"id":11246,"name":"leek","localizedName":"leek","image":"leeks.jpg"},{"id":20444,"name":"rice","localizedName":"rice","image":"uncooked-white-rice.png"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","localizedName":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"},{"id":0,"name":"soup","localizedName":"soup","image":""}],"equipment":[{"id":404752,"name":"pot","localizedName":"pot","image":"stock-pot.jpg"}],"length":{"number":117,"unit":"minutes"}}]}],"spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/spicy-lentil-and-black-rice-soup-with-kale-spinach-and-leek-661122","usedIngredientCount":0,"missedIngredientCount":15,"missedIngredients":[{"id":10020036,"amount":1.0,"unit":"cup","unitLong":"cup","unitShort":"cup","aisle":"Pasta and Rice","name":"rice","original":"1 cup black rice","originalName":"black rice","meta":["black"],"extendedName":"black rice","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/black-rice.jpg"},{"id":11124,"amount":2.0,"unit":"cups","unitLong":"cups","unitShort":"cup","aisle":"Produce","name":"carrot","original":"2 cups diced carrot","originalName":"diced carrot","meta":["diced"],"extendedName":"diced carrot","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sliced-carrot.png"},{"id":2031,"amount":0.25,"unit":"tsp","unitLong":"teaspoons","unitShort":"tsp","aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","name":"cayenne","original":"1/4 tsp cayenne","originalName":"cayenne","meta":[],"image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chili-powder.jpg"},{"id":10111143,"amount":2.0,"unit":"","unitLong":"","unitShort":"","aisle":"Produce","name":"celery stalks","original":"2 celery stalks (diced)","originalName":"celery stalks (diced)","meta":["diced","()"],"extendedName":"diced celery stalks","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/celery.jpg"},{"id":2009,"amount":1.0,"unit":"tablespoon","unitLong":"tablespoon","unitShort":"Tbsp","aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","name":"chili powder","original":"1 tablespoon chili powder","originalName":"chili powder","meta":[],"image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/chili-powder.jpg"},{"id":1002014,"amount":1.0,"unit":"tsp","unitLong":"teaspoon","unitShort":"tsp","aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","name":"cumin","original":"1 tsp cumin","originalName":"cumin","meta":[],"image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/ground-cumin.jpg"},{"id":10216069,"amount":2.0,"unit":"cups","unitLong":"cups","unitShort":"cup","aisle":"Pasta and Rice;Canned and Jarred","name":"green lentils","original":"2 cups green lentils","originalName":"green lentils","meta":[],"image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/lentils-green.jpg"},{"id":2042,"amount":1.0,"unit":"tsp","unitLong":"teaspoon","unitShort":"tsp","aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","name":"thyme","original":"1 tsp dried thyme","originalName":"dried thyme","meta":["dried"],"extendedName":"dried thyme","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/thyme.jpg"},{"id":10211215,"amount":3.0,"unit":"","unitLong":"","unitShort":"","aisle":"Produce","name":"garlic cloves","original":"3 garlic cloves (minced)","originalName":"garlic cloves (minced)","meta":["minced","()"],"image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/garlic.jpg"},{"id":11233,"amount":1.0,"unit":"bunch","unitLong":"bunch","unitShort":"bunch","aisle":"Produce","name":"kale","original":"1 bunch kale (chopped -

Then add the cucumber, again keep it on the heat another couple minutes.Now just toss in your potatoes, add some water until they are almost completely covered. Throw in the rest of the spices; caraway, bay leaf, tomato paste, parsley, chili flakes and salt. Taste, add a little more if you need to. You can go pretty heavy on the paprika, but should be careful with the caraway, it's pretty intense.At this point you just cover the whole thing, and let it simmer for a while, until the potatoes are through. Check on  the water situation every now and again, the potatoes should be almost completely covered at all times.When the potatoes are through you can start the thickening process. I just dissolved one teaspoon of flour in a little bit of water (you don't just want to throw it in the gulasch, since the flour could form into little chunks) So just pour in your mixture, slowly (not everything at once!), let it simmer and wait to see how much it thickens, and then if still to watery, add more.I also took out a couple of the potatoes, mashed them, and put them back (just another way to make the whole thing less watery)","ingredients":[{"id":1032009,"name":"red pepper flakes","localizedName":"red pepper
